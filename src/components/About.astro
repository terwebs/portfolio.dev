        Hello, my name is Webster Mu√±oz. I started coding in 2014, however, I couldn't fully take off into this amazing web development world until 2022 when I decided to start my self-taugh journey.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Ever since then, I have dedicated my time to learning and practicing. I was able to enter the tech industry as a QA Engineer and Project Manager. A few months later, I had the opportunity to contribute to multiple projects not only as a project manager but also as a front-end developer.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am really enjoying the opportunity to learn new technologies, overcome different challenges, and improve every day. I hope to continue contributing to the development of great products.
